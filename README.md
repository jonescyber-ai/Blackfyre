# **Blackfyre**

**Blackfyre** is an open-source platform designed to standardize and streamline binary analysis. It provides tools and APIs for extracting, analyzing, and storing binary data in a disassembler-agnostic and architecture-agnostic format. This enables consistent workflows for advanced reverse engineering tasks powered by AI/ML, NLP, and LLMs.

---

### **Origin and Purpose**

Blackfyre was originally developed to support the course **"Automating Reverse Engineering Processes with AI/ML, NLP, and LLMs"** at **Blackhat** (since 2019) and **RECON** (since 2023). The platform was created to demonstrate and teach cutting-edge techniques for automating reverse engineering workflows using advanced machine learning and natural language processing tools. Today, Blackfyre continues to empower developers and researchers with a robust framework for integrating AI-driven workflows into reverse engineering.

---

### **What is Blackfyre?**

Blackfyre consists of two core components:

1. **Disassembler Plugins**  
   Extract structured data and metadata from binaries and save them in the **Binary Context Container (BCC)** format. This ensures compatibility and standardization for subsequent analysis across different tools and architectures.

2. **Python Library**  
   Provides APIs for working with BCC files, enabling detailed analysis of binary data, including functions, basic blocks, instructions, and their relationships. These APIs are designed to integrate seamlessly into workflows that leverage AI/ML and NLP techniques for advanced binary analysis.

### Integration with PyVEX and Vex IR

A key feature of Blackfyre is its integration with **pyvex**, a library for lifting disassembly code to an intermediate representation (IR) called **Vex IR**. This enables users to perform architecture-agnostic analysis across a wide range of supported architectures. With Vex IR, you can analyze binaries at a higher level of abstraction while maintaining precise control over low-level details.

#### Architectures Supported by Vex IR
By leveraging pyvex, Blackfyre supports analysis for the following architectures:
- **x86 (32-bit and 64-bit)**
- **ARM (32-bit and 64-bit)**
- **MIPS (32-bit and 64-bit)**
- **PowerPC (32-bit and 64-bit)**

This architecture coverage ensures Blackfyre can be applied to a wide range of binaries, making it an essential tool for cross-platform analysis.

---

## Key Features

1. **Disassembler-Agnostic**:
   - Integrates with multiple disassemblers, including **Ghidra**, and allows additional plugins to be developed for **IDA Pro** and **Binary Ninja**.

2. **Architecture-Agnostic**:
   - By using pyvex and Vex IR, Blackfyre enables analysis across all architectures supported by Vex IR, ensuring a consistent workflow for heterogeneous binaries.

3. **Comprehensive Data Extraction**:
   - Strings, imports, exports, constants, functions, basic blocks, and raw binary data can all be extracted and analyzed.

4. **Advanced Analysis APIs**:
   - Explore decompiled functions, instruction details, basic blocks, and function relationships (callers and callees).

5. **Optimized for AI/ML Integration**:
   - Blackfyreâ€™s structured output makes it easy to integrate binary analysis workflows into AI/ML pipelines, enabling advanced research and automation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Ghidra (optional, for Ghidra Plugin)

### Installing the Blackfyre Python Library

Blackfyre relies on pyvex, which has a straightforward installation process via pip on x86_64/AMD64 architectures. 
However, installation on ARM-based architectures (e.g., Mac M1/M2) can be more complex and may require additional troubleshooting.

#### Steps for Installation:
1. Clone the Blackfyre repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jonescyber-ai/Blackfyre.git
   cd Blackfyre
   ```

2. Install the Python library:
   ```sh
   cd src/python
   pip install -e .
   ```
   
3. **Resolve pyvex installation issues (if applicable)**:
   - For x86_64/AMD64 systems:
     - `pyvex` should install without issues using `pip`, as it has prebuilt wheels for these architectures.
   - For ARM-based systems (e.g., Mac M1/M2):
     - Installation can be more challenging. A potential workaround is:
       - Use the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/) to create a virtual environment.
       - Install `pyvex` and its dependencies manually within this environment.
     - There is no guarantee this workaround will work and additional troubleshooting may still be required.
3. Go back to the root directory:
   ```sh
   cd ../../
   ```   

4. Verify the install by running the example python script:
   ```sh
    python examples/python/example_displaying_binary_metadata.py
    ```
   If the script runs without errors, the installation was successful.

#### Additional Notes:
- On x86_64/AMD64 systems, the installation process for `Blackfyre` is typically smooth due to the availability of prebuilt binaries for `pyvex`.
- On ARM-based systems, some dependencies might need to be built from source, which can require additional configuration.
- If you encounter errors or need further assistance, refer to the `pyvex` GitHub repository or community forums for guidance.

## Ghidra Plugin 

The **Blackfyre Ghidra Plugin** enables streamlined extraction of binary data into the BCC format. This plugin is specifically designed for users of the Ghidra reverse engineering tool and serves as a central component of Blackfyre's data extraction pipeline.

### Features
- **Seamless Integration**: Adds Blackfyreâ€™s capabilities directly to Ghidra.
- **Consistent Output**: Ensures data is captured in the standardized BCC format.
- **Extensibility**: Additional plugins can be written for other disassemblers like **IDA Pro** and **Binary Ninja**.

### **Installation and Usage of the Ghidra Plugin**

1. **Download the Plugin**:
   - Locate the latest `ghidra_*.zip` plugin file in the [Releases section](https://github.com/jonescyber-ai/Blackfyre/releases) of the Blackfyre repository.
   - Ensure you select the plugin version that matches your Ghidra version, as the plugin is tied to the specific Ghidra version it was built for.

2. **Install the Plugin in Ghidra**:
   - Open Ghidra and navigate to **File > Install Extensions**.
   - In the **Install Extensions** dialog:
     - Click on the "Plus" icon to add a new extension.
     - Browse to the location of the downloaded `ghidra_*.zip` file.
     - Select the file and click **OK**.
   - After installation, restart Ghidra for the plugin to be fully loaded.

3. **Run the Ghidra Script to Generate the BCC**:
   - Open the binary you want to analyze in Ghidra.
   - Navigate to **Script Manager** from the **Window** menu or toolbar.
   - Locate and run the script `GenerateBinaryContext.java`.
   - During execution, the script will prompt you for the following inputs:
     - **Output Directory**: Specify where the `.bcc` file should be saved.
     - **Include Raw Binary**: Indicate whether to include the raw binary in the `.bcc` file. Including it will increase the file size.
     - **Include Decompiled Code**: Specify if decompiled code should be included. Note that decompilation will add processing time, and in the worst case, the time will scale as `timeout Ã— number of functions`.
     - **Decompilation Timeout**: Enter the timeout value for decompiling each function, if applicable. If decompiled code is not needed, set this option to "No" to avoid delays.

4. **Verify Installation and Output**:
   - After running the script, verify that the `.bcc` file has been generated in the specified output directory.
   - Check the content of the `.bcc` file to ensure it includes the selected components (e.g., raw binary or decompiled code).
   - If any errors occur during script execution, refer to the error messages for troubleshooting.

5. **Notes**:
   - Always use a plugin version compatible with your Ghidra version to avoid compatibility issues.
   - Excluding decompiled code can significantly reduce processing time, especially for binaries with a large number of functions.
   - If you encounter issues during installation or script execution, refer to the plugin documentation _(if available)_ or open an issue in the Blackfyre repository.


### **Using Ghidra in Headless Mode**

Ghidra supports running scripts and performing automated tasks in headless mode. This is particularly useful for batch processing or when a graphical user interface (GUI) is not required.

#### **Headless Mode Overview**
- The headless mode is executed using the `analyzeHeadless` script provided in the Ghidra installation under the `support` directory.
- You can use this mode to import binaries, run scripts, delete projects, and more.

#### **Examples Provided**
This repository includes example scripts for running Ghidra in headless mode:

- **Linux**: `example_generate_bcc_headless.sh`
- **Windows**: `example_generate_bcc_headless.bat`

These scripts demonstrate how to configure and execute Ghidra's headless mode for generating the binary context container (BCC) using the `GenerateBinaryContext.java` script.

### Building the Ghidra Plugin

The Ghidra plugin requires a specific version of `protobuf-java`. For **Blackfyre v1.0.0**, the required version is **3.25.1**. Follow these steps to ensure you have the correct dependency:

#### 1. **Download the Required JAR File**

You can find the specific `protobuf-java` JAR file needed for your Blackfyre version in the [Releases section](https://github.com/jonescyber-ai/Blackfyre/releases). For **Blackfyre v1.0.0**, download `protobuf-java-3.25.1.jar` from the following URL:

```bash
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/protobuf/protobuf-java/3.25.1/protobuf-java-3.25.1.jar
```

#### 2. **Place the JAR File**

Place the downloaded JAR file in the appropriate location required by the pluginâ€™s build system. Typically, this would involve placing it in a `libs` directory or configuring your build script (e.g., `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`) to reference the file.

#### **Step 3: Build the Ghidra Plugin**

Before building the Ghidra plugin, ensure all required dependencies, including the correct version of `protobuf-java`, are set up properly.

If you are new to building Ghidra extensions, refer to the following resources for detailed guidance:
- **[GhidraDev Plugin README](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev/GhidraDevPlugin/README.md)**: Learn how to configure and use the GhidraDev plugin for developing and building extensions.
- **[Ghidra Advanced Development Guide](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/GhidraDocs/GhidraClass/AdvancedDevelopment/GhidraAdvancedDevelopment_withNotes.html)**: A comprehensive tutorial on advanced Ghidra extension development.

Once your development environment is set up:
1. Compile the plugin using the GhidraDev plugin for Eclipse, the officially supported development environment for creating and building Ghidra extensions. 
2. Ensure your Eclipse IDE is properly configured with the GhidraDev plugin and all necessary dependencies are in place.
3. Verify the build output to ensure no errors or missing dependencies.
4. Deploy and test the plugin within your Ghidra environment.

#### Notes:
- Using an incorrect version of `protobuf-java` may result in build errors or runtime issues. Ensure you use version **3.25.1** for **Blackfyre v1.0.0**.
- If you upgrade to a newer version of Blackfyre in the future, refer to the release notes to confirm the required version of `protobuf-java`.
